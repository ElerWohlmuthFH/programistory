    <body>Ada s childhood lacked fairy tales and princesses, even though her father was the famed Lord Byron. Instead,
        her mother raised her on science. Ada Lovelace immediately gravitated towards machines and obsessed over the
        inventions of the Industrial Revolution. At age 12, Ada envisioned a flying machine with the form of a horse
        with a steam engine in the inside so contrived as to move an immense pair of wings. Introduced by her mentor to
        Charles Babbage, at age seventeen Ada Lovelace became interested in the Analytical Engine, the invention the
        Mathematics professor was working on.
        Expanding on her interest of the machine, Ada Lovelace translated an article written by an Italian mathematician
        describing the computer-like machine. Impressed with her work, Charles Babbage asked Ada to expand on the
        article and this is where Ada made history.
