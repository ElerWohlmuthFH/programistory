            Taking evening classes for six years, she obtained an honors degree in mathematics and married physicist
            Derek Shirley in 1962.
            Starting her company at her kitchen table with just a few pounds investment,
            the company grew quickly and, by 1975, had over 300 programmers, 297 of them women.
            The company, which had become F International, was floated on the London Stock Exchange
            (after Shirley had given many shares to her employees) and changed its name to Xansa in 2001.
            She retired in 1993 and has since been very active in philanthropy via the Shirley Foundation,
            particularly for charities supporting research into autism and emerging technologies.
            As well as receiving dozens of honors, Shirley is former president of the British Computer Society
            and a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. She has given away most of her wealth to philanthropic
            causes, including a gift of Â£10 million to found the Oxford Internet Institute.</p>
