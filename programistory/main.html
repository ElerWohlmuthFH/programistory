        <p>Ada s childhood lacked fairy tales and princesses, even though her father was the famed Lord Byron. Instead,
            her mother raised her on science. Ada Lovelace immediately gravitated towards machines and obsessed over the
            inventions of the Industrial Revolution. At age 12, Ada envisioned a flying machine with the form of a horse
            with a steam engine in the inside so contrived as to move an immense pair of wings. Introduced by her mentor
            to Charles Babbage, at age seventeen Ada Lovelace became interested in the Analytical Engine, the invention
            the
            Mathematics professor was working on.
            Expanding on her interest of the machine, Ada Lovelace translated an article written by an Italian
            mathematician
            describing the computer-like machine. Impressed with her work, Charles Babbage asked Ada to expand on the
            article and this is where Ada made history.</p>

        <p>Edith Clarke was the first female electrical engineer. She was also the first female professor of electrical
            engineering
            at the University of Texas at Austin. Born to a family of nine children, she was orphaned at the age of
            12.<br>
            She used her inheritance to fund her college education and became a graduate in mathematics.
            She taught at a private school before joining AT&T. While she worked there,
            she managed to complete her degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University.<br>
            She later became the first woman to enroll and earn a masters degree in electrical engineering
            from Massachusetts Institute of technology. Her most famous contribution is the Clarke calculator
            that solved equations involving hyperbolic functions ten times faster than other devices of the time.<br>

        <p>The programmers of the ENIAC computer in 1944, were six female mathematicians;<br>
            Marlyn Meltzer, Betty Holberton, Kathleen Antonelli, Ruth Teitelbaum, Jean Bartik, and Frances Spence
            who were human computers at the Moore School's computation lab.<br> Adele Goldstine was their teacher and
            trainer
            and they were known as the "ENIAC girls. <br> The women who worked on ENIAC were warned that they would not
            be promoted
            into professional ratings which were only for men.<br> Designing the hardware was "men's work"
            and programming the software was "women's work". Sometimes women were given blueprints and
            wiring diagrams to figure out how the machine worked and how to program it.<br>
            They learned how the ENIAC worked by repairing it, sometimes crawling through the computer,
            and by fixing "bugs" in the machinery.<br> Even though the programmers were supposed to be doing the
            "soft" work of programming, in reality, they did that and fully understood and worked with the hardware of
            the ENIAC.<br>
            When the ENIAC was revealed in 1946, Goldstine and the other women prepared the machine and the
            demonstration programs
            it ran for the public.<br> None of their work in preparing the demonstrations was mentioned in the official
            accounts of the
            public events.<br>
            After the demonstration, the university hosted an expensive celebratory dinner to which none of the ENIAC
            six were invited.<br>

        <p>Nothing or no one could hinder Annie Easley’s thirst for knowledge.
            She began her career at NACA (before it was NASA) as a “human computer” in a lab where she did computations
            for researchers.
            Once machines replaced human computers, she then continued to grow her skill set and became a computer
            programmer.
            She worked on numerous projects for NASA and her code was used in researching energy conversion systems,
            which led to battery technology used for early hybrid vehicles.
            She also worked on Centaur technology - a high-energy rocket technology to boost rockets into space.

            Still wanting to grow her knowledge, she then returned to school to get her degree in Mathematics
            while still working full time. An advocate for equality in the workplace,
            she later took on the role of equal employment opportunity counsellor at NASA
            and helped supervisors address issues of gender, race and age discrimination.</p>

        <p> Dame Stephanie (“Steve”) Shirley founded Freelance Programmers in 1962
            to offer women who were busy with elder care or child-rearing a means of earning a living,
            as well as developing professionally as computer programmers. The company was created by a woman for women.
            Originally a Kindertransport child, Shirley came to the United Kingdom with her sister Renate in July 1939
            at five years old,
            “terrified and weeping,” and spent her early years living a serene existence in the English Midlands and
            then near
            the Welsh border. She studied mathematics by attending classes at the local boys school, since that subject
            was not
            offered at her (girls) school.
            In the 1950s, after graduating high school,
            she worked at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill

        <p>In 1965, Mary Kenneth Keller was the first woman in the US to be awarded a PhD in Computer Science,
            having previously studied Mathematics and Physics.<br>
            Earlier she had taken her vows as a Roman Catholic religious sister in Ohio and in 1958 had started
            work at Dartmouth College in the male-only (at the time) computer centre.<br>
            At Dartmouth Mary worked on developing the BASIC programming language.
            BASIC is a way of translating the zeroes and ones of computer code into something more intuitive and
            straightforward.
            It is a general-purpose, high level programming language which helped broaden computer programming
            into non maths and science fields, subsequently giving many people their first experience with programming.
            Sister Mary later set up the computing department at Clarke College in Iowa, which she then led for twenty
            years,
            becoming passionate about the potential for computers to increase access to information and to promote
            education.
            She envisioned a world in which computers made people smarter and predicted the information explosion that
            would
            happen decades later. Her vision was ahead of her time.<br>
            Sister Mary worked hard to forge her own unique path in life and was a passionate
            advocate for women in computing. The computer centre at Clarke College is called the Keller Computer Centre
            in her honour.<br>

            In 1960, Margaret Hamilton was working as a programmer at MIT in order to support her husband through his
            law degree.
            Margaret told Futurism, “The very first languages I programmed in were hexadecimal and binary.
            There was no school to attend or field to learn what today is known as ‘software engineering’ or ‘systems
            engineering.’
            When answers could not be found, we had to invent them.” Margaret’s work at MIT turned into so much more
            when the Apollo space program hit the scene.
            When NASA turned to MIT to engineer the Apollo, Margaret took on the job of onboard flight software,
            although the software was nowhere in the Apollo’s original plans. In order to
            Margaret would punch holes in stacks of punch cards and have them processed by a large Honeywell computer
            that simulated the Apollo.
            Margaret helped save the Apollo 8 flight after a human error and showed the world the possibilities of
            software.
            Margaret Hamilton was honored with NASA’s Exceptional Space Act Award and is credited with naming the term
            “software engineering”.

            processing and information retrieval.
            Spärck Jones had a long history in experimental investigations of human language.
            She was the originator of the Inverse Document Frequency measure in information retrieval
            (1972, A statistical interpretation of term specificity and its application in retrieval., Journal of
            Documentation, 28:11–21)
            which is nearly ubiquitously used as part of the measure of the importance of various words contained in
            documents when searching for information. (The English word 'the', for example, is very unimportant, as it
            occurs in essentially all English documents, thus having high document frequency and low inverse document
            frequency.) . She was also at one time president of the Association for Computation Linguistics.
            Awards Jones won in her lifetime include Fellowships of the American and European Artificial Intelligence
            societies,
            Fellowship of the British Academy, the ACL Lifetime Achievement Award and the Lovelace Medal of the British

            Anita Borg was a computer scientist and a staunch advocate for the advancement of women programmers.
            Borg, who herself discovered programming in her 20s and graduated from New York University with a PhD in
            computer science,
            has probably done more than anyone else to advance the cause of women in tech.
            Among her endeavors:<br>
            • In 1987, she co-founded Systers, an online community for women to discuss the issues they experienced at
            work.
            • In 1994, she co-founded the Grace Hopper Celebration, a gathering of women technologists that’s not only
            still going strong but continues to grow with each passing year.
            • Finally, Borg created the Institute for Women and Technology, which combined her previous
            community-building efforts with new programs intended both to support women already working in tech and to
            encourage other women to enter the field.
            Following Borg’s death in 2003, the organization was renamed The Anita Borg Institute for Women and
            Technology and has since shortened its name to AnitaB.org.<br>

            Barbara Liskov (b.1939) Invented 2 Programming Languages
            It was only because she couldn’t find an interesting job in mathematics that Barbara Liskov became a
            programmer,
            Barbara told EngineerGirl. With her first two years of experience in programming, Barbara was hungry to
            learn more.
            She attended Stanford University before there was even a computer science program.
            At Stanford, Barbara Liskov worked with John McCarthy on artificial intelligence projects and became the
            first woman
            to earn a doctorate in computer science at the program’s beginnings.
            Through her academic and corporate work, Barbara made significant contributions to the advance of coding.
            She led the design and implementation of CLU, the creation of the first high-level language Argus
            to support data abstraction, and the Liskov substitution principle for object-oriented programming.
            In 2008, Barbara Liskov won the A.M. Turing Award, one of the greatest honors in computer science.
            Barbara is a professor at MIT. Her innovations can be seen in every modern programming language
            including Java, C#, and C++.
            “Be prepared to change your goals if that turns out to be the right thing for you.”
            Barbara counseled upcoming women interested in technology.
