        <p>Ada s childhood lacked fairy tales and princesses, even though her father was the famed Lord Byron. Instead,
            her mother raised her on science. Ada Lovelace immediately gravitated towards machines and obsessed over the
            inventions of the Industrial Revolution. At age 12, Ada envisioned a flying machine with the form of a horse
            with a steam engine in the inside so contrived as to move an immense pair of wings. Introduced by her mentor
            to Charles Babbage, at age seventeen Ada Lovelace became interested in the Analytical Engine, the invention
            the
            Mathematics professor was working on.
            Expanding on her interest of the machine, Ada Lovelace translated an article written by an Italian
            mathematician
            describing the computer-like machine. Impressed with her work, Charles Babbage asked Ada to expand on the
            article and this is where Ada made history.</p>

            relay computer
            From 1941-1946 (at the same time he developed his Z4 computer), Konrad Zuse developed ideas as to how his
            machines could be programmed in a very powerful way. The language Plankalkül was initially described in
            Zuse’s planned Ph.D. dissertation in 1943, later developed in his 1945 (also unpublished, it was still
            wartime) work "Plankalkül. Theorie del angewandten Logistik.", and finally reached the public in a 1948
            article (but still did not attract much feedback and for a long time to come programming a computer would
            only be thought of as programming with machine code). Plankalkül was eventually more comprehensively
            published in a 1972 paper, while the first compiler for it was implemented as late as in 1998.

            into professional ratings which were only for men.<br> Designing the hardware was "men's work"
            and programming the software was "women's work". Sometimes women were given blueprints and
            wiring diagrams to figure out how the machine worked and how to program it.<br>

            "soft" work of programming, in reality, they did that and fully understood and worked with the hardware of
            the ENIAC.<br>
            When the ENIAC was revealed in 1946, Goldstine and the other women prepared the machine and the
            demonstration programs

            ALGOL, computer programming language designed by an international committee of the Association of Computing
            Machinery (ACM), led by Alan J. Perlis of Carnegie Mellon University, during 1958–60 for publishing
            algorithms, as well as for doing computations. Like LISP, ALGOL had recursive subprograms—procedures that
            could invoke themselves to solve a problem by reducing it to a smaller problem of the same kind. ALGOL
            introduced block structure, in which a program is composed of blocks that might contain both data and
            instructions and have the same structure as an entire program. Block structure became a powerful tool for
            building large programs out of small components.

        <p>Nothing or no one could hinder Annie Easley’s thirst for knowledge.
            She began her career at NACA (before it was NASA) as a “human computer” in a lab where she did computations
            for researchers.
            Once machines replaced human computers, she then continued to grow her skill set and became a computer
            programmer.
            She worked on numerous projects for NASA and her code was used in researching energy conversion systems,
            which led to battery technology used for early hybrid vehicles.
            She also worked on Centaur technology - a high-energy rocket technology to boost rockets into space.

            Still wanting to grow her knowledge, she then returned to school to get her degree in Mathematics
            while still working full time. An advocate for equality in the workplace,
            she later took on the role of equal employment opportunity counsellor at NASA
            and helped supervisors address issues of gender, race and age discrimination.

            At Dartmouth Mary worked on developing the BASIC programming language.
            BASIC is a way of translating the zeroes and ones of computer code into something more intuitive and
            straightforward.
            It is a general-purpose, high level programming language which helped broaden computer programming
            into non maths and science fields, subsequently giving many people their first experience with programming.
            Sister Mary later set up the computing department at Clarke College in Iowa, which she then led for twenty
            years,
            becoming passionate about the potential for computers to increase access to information and to promote
            education.
            She envisioned a world in which computers made people smarter and predicted the information explosion that
            would
            happen decades later. Her vision was ahead of her time.<br>

            In 1960, Margaret Hamilton was working as a programmer at MIT in order to support her husband through his
            law degree.
            Margaret told Futurism, “The very first languages I programmed in were hexadecimal and binary.
            There was no school to attend or field to learn what today is known as ‘software engineering’ or ‘systems
            engineering.’
            When answers could not be found, we had to invent them.” Margaret’s work at MIT turned into so much more
            when the Apollo space program hit the scene.
            When NASA turned to MIT to engineer the Apollo, Margaret took on the job of onboard flight software,
            although the software was nowhere in the Apollo’s original plans. In order to
            Margaret would punch holes in stacks of punch cards and have them processed by a large Honeywell computer
            that simulated the Apollo.
            Margaret helped save the Apollo 8 flight after a human error and showed the world the possibilities of
            software.
            Margaret Hamilton was honored with NASA’s Exceptional Space Act Award and is credited with naming the term

            Adele Goldberg is a computer scientist. She is one of the creators of Smalltalk-80—a programming language
            while
            working at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC).
            Adele currently works at Neometron, Inc., an internet support provider she founded.
            She continues to pursue her love of education, creating computer sciences courses at various school
            internationally.
            In 1988, Adele co-founded ParcPlace Systems. By then, Smalltalk-80 had been applied to different software,
            and ParcPlace Systems provided development tools for the companies behind this software.
            She was chairperson and president of the company until 1995 when it merged with Digitalk.
            From 1984 to 1986, she was president of the Association for Computing Machinery.
            Adele started at PARC in 1973 as a research assistant.
            She went on to become manager of the Systems Concepts Laboratory where she developed Smalltalk-80.
            Smalltalk-80 was easier to use and customizable. Adele also created some of the design patterns that would
            go
            on to be the most commonly used in software design.<br>

        <p>Karen Spärck Jones (1935–2007) was a British computer scientist. Her specialties were natural language
            processing and information retrieval.
            Spärck Jones had a long history in experimental investigations of human language.
            She was the originator of the Inverse Document Frequency measure in information retrieval
            (1972, A statistical interpretation of term specificity and its application in retrieval., Journal of
            Documentation, 28:11–21)
            which is nearly ubiquitously used as part of the measure of the importance of various words contained in
            documents when searching for information. (The English word 'the', for example, is very unimportant, as it
            occurs in essentially all English documents, thus having high document frequency and low inverse document
            frequency.) . She was also at one time president of the Association for Computation Linguistics.
            Awards Jones won in her lifetime include Fellowships of the American and European Artificial Intelligence
            societies,
            Fellowship of the British Academy, the ACL Lifetime Achievement Award and the Lovelace Medal of the British
            Computer Society.

            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g.,
            having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side
            versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than
            downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide
            programmatic control over them.
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
            elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
            variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:<br>
            • Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
            Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on
            an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.<br>
            • Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
            server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
            continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations
            on a server.
            This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise,
            Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.

        <p>Carol Shaw (1955- ) is a retired video game developer, and was one of the first female video game designers.
            She was born and raised in Palo Alto, California. Her father was a mechanical engineer,
            and she preferred playing with her brother’s model railroad set over her own dolls.
            When her father got laid off, her mother went back to work at the Stanford Library, working in serial
            records
            and periodicals. She played arcade games at the miniature golf course, specifically the first commercial
            arcade game,
            Computer Space, where she would partner with her brother or a friend to control all the buttons.

            C# is a modern, general-purpose programming language that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks and
            objectives that span over a variety of professions. C# is primarily used on the Windows .NET framework,
            although it can be applied to an open source platform. This highly versatile programming language is an
            object-oriented programming language (OOP)—which isn’t very common—and fairly new to the game, yet already a
            reliable crowd pleaser.

            Anita Borg was a computer scientist and a staunch advocate for the advancement of women programmers.
            Borg, who herself discovered programming in her 20s and graduated from New York University with a PhD in
            computer science,
            has probably done more than anyone else to advance the cause of women in tech.
            Among her endeavors:<br>
            • In 1987, she co-founded Systers, an online community for women to discuss the issues they experienced at
            work.<br>
            • In 1994, she co-founded the Grace Hopper Celebration, a gathering of women technologists that’s not only
            still going strong but continues to grow with each passing year.<br>
            • Finally, Borg created the Institute for Women and Technology, which combined her previous
            community-building efforts with new programs intended both to support women already working in tech and to
            encourage other women to enter the field.<br>
            Following Borg’s death in 2003, the organization was renamed The Anita Borg Institute for Women and
            Technology and has since shortened its name to AnitaB.org.<br>

        <p>Go (also called Golang or Go language) is an open source programming language used for general purpose. Go
            was developed by Google engineers to create dependable and efficient software. Most similarly modeled after
            C, Go is statically typed and explicit.
            The language was designed by taking inspiration for the productivity and relative simplicity of Python, with
            the ability of C. Some of the problems that Go addresses are slow build time, uncontrolled dependencies,
            effort duplication, difficulty of writing automatic tools and cross-language development.
            Go works by using "goroutines," or lightweight processes, which allows further efficiencies. Go also uses a
            collection of packages for efficient dependency management.
            Some examples of organizations that use Go include Google, Cloudflare, Dropbox, MongoDB, Netflix,
            SoundCloud, Twitch and Uber.

            Barbara Liskov (b.1939) Invented 2 Programming Languages
            It was only because she couldn’t find an interesting job in mathematics that Barbara Liskov became a
            programmer,
            Barbara told EngineerGirl. With her first two years of experience in programming, Barbara was hungry to
            learn more.
            She attended Stanford University before there was even a computer science program.
            At Stanford, Barbara Liskov worked with John McCarthy on artificial intelligence projects and became the
            first woman
            to earn a doctorate in computer science at the program’s beginnings.
            Through her academic and corporate work, Barbara made significant contributions to the advance of coding.
            She led the design and implementation of CLU, the creation of the first high-level language Argus
            to support data abstraction, and the Liskov substitution principle for object-oriented programming.
            In 2008, Barbara Liskov won the A.M. Turing Award, one of the greatest honors in computer science.
            Barbara is a professor at MIT. Her innovations can be seen in every modern programming language
            including Java, C#, and C++.
            “Be prepared to change your goals if that turns out to be the right thing for you.”
            Barbara counseled upcoming women interested in technology.

            <p>Kotlin is a general purpose, free, open source, statically typed “pragmatic” programming language
                initially designed for the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and Android that combines object-oriented and
                functional programming features. It is focused on interoperability, safety, clarity, and tooling
                support. Versions of Kotlin targeting JavaScript ES5.1 and native code (using LLVM) for a number of
                processors are in production as well.
                Kotlin originated at JetBrains, the company behind IntelliJ IDEA, in 2010, and has been open source
                since 2012. The Kotlin team currently has more than 90 full-time members from JetBrains, and the Kotlin
                project on GitHub has more than 300 contributors. JetBrains uses Kotlin in many of its products
                including its flagship IntelliJ IDEA.
