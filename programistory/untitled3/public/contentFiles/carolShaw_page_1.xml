        <p>Carol Shaw (1955- ) is a retired video game developer, and was one of the first female video game designers.
            She was born and raised in Palo Alto, California. Her father was a mechanical engineer,
            and she preferred playing with her brotherâ€™s model railroad set over her own dolls.
            When her father got laid off, her mother went back to work at the Stanford Library, working in serial records
            and periodicals. She played arcade games at the miniature golf course, specifically the first commercial arcade game,
            Computer Space, where she would partner with her brother or a friend to control all the buttons.
            She first used a computer in high school, and discovered that she could play text-based games on it.
