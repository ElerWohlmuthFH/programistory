            Dame Stephanie (“Steve”) Shirley founded Freelance Programmers in 1962
            to offer women who were busy with elder care or child-rearing a means of earning a living,
            as well as developing professionally as computer programmers. The company was created by a woman for women.
            Originally a Kindertransport child, Shirley came to the United Kingdom with her sister Renate in July 1939
            at five years old,
            “terrified and weeping,” and spent her early years living a serene existence in the English Midlands and
            then near
            the Welsh border. She studied mathematics by attending classes at the local boys school, since that subject
            was not
            offered at her (girls) school. In the 1950s, after graduating high school,
            she worked at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill
            (where World War II code-breaking machines had been built).
