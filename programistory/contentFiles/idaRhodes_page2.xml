        Seven years later, Ida’s boss sent her to Washington to learn about the creation of an electronic computer
        which would come to change the course of Ida’s life.
        The people in Washington were so impressed with Ida Rhodes, they wanted to work with her more.
        She worked in the Machine Development Laboratory consulting with government agencies and in the development
        of the analysis of systems of programming. Ida designed the C-10 language for the U.S. Census Bureau and
        created the original programming for the Social Security Administrations.
        Ida was also a pioneer in the use of computers to support language translation.
        Ida Rhodes was awarded the Exceptional Service Gold Medal and Certificate of Appreciation
