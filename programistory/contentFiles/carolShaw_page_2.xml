            She first used a computer in high school, and discovered that she could play text-based games on it.
            She became interested in computers, and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1977
            with a BS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and a year later received a masterâ€™s degree as well,
            in Computer Science. She was hired by Atari to program games for the new VCS console. While working for Atari in 1978,
            although her official job title was Microprocessor Software Engineer, she designed Polo (unreleased), 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe,
            and Video Checkers. She left Atari in 1980 to work for Tandem Computers, but was contacted by Activision just over
            a year later to join their team: at Activision, she designed Happy Trails, and River Raid, which is universally
            regarded as a masterpiece of game design for the Atari 2600. She returned to Tandem from 1984-1990 before retiring
            early, which she credits to the success of River Raid.
