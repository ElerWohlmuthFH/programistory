        Ida Rhodes was born Hadassah Itzkowitz in a Jewish Village in Ukraine.
        In 1913, her parents brought her to the United States where she would later attend Cornell and Columbia University.
        Ida was known to race with a group of friends to make Einsteinâ€™s informal lectures at Princeton.
        As part of the New Deal program created by President Roosevelt, the Mathematical Tables Project was created and Ida Rhodes was taken onboard.
        She was placed as a planner and supervisor of the Handbook of Mathematical Functions.</p>
