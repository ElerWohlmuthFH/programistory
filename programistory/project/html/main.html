        <p>Ada s childhood lacked fairy tales and princesses, even though her father was the famed Lord Byron. Instead,
            her mother raised her on science. Ada Lovelace immediately gravitated towards machines and obsessed over the
            inventions of the Industrial Revolution. At age 12, Ada envisioned a flying machine with the form of a horse
            with a steam engine in the inside so contrived as to move an immense pair of wings. Introduced by her mentor
            to Charles Babbage, at age seventeen Ada Lovelace became interested in the Analytical Engine, the invention
            the
            Mathematics professor was working on.
            Expanding on her interest of the machine, Ada Lovelace translated an article written by an Italian
            mathematician
            describing the computer-like machine. Impressed with her work, Charles Babbage asked Ada to expand on the
            article and this is where Ada made history.</p>

        <p>Plankakül
            The world’s first complete high-level language was designed in 1940s (probably between 1941 and 1945, but the concept first published in 1948), by the german computer pioneer Konrad Zuse, the creator of the first relay computer
            From 1941-1946 (at the same time he developed his Z4 computer), Konrad Zuse developed ideas as to how his machines could be programmed in a very powerful way. The language Plankalkül was initially described in Zuse’s planned Ph.D. dissertation in 1943, later developed in his 1945 (also unpublished, it was still wartime) work "Plankalkül. Theorie del angewandten Logistik.", and finally reached the public in a 1948 article (but still did not attract much feedback and for a long time to come programming a computer would only be thought of as programming with machine code). Plankalkül was eventually more comprehensively published in a 1972 paper, while the first compiler for it was implemented as late as in 1998.

        <p>Edith Clarke was the first female electrical engineer. She was also the first female professor of electrical
            engineering
            at the University of Texas at Austin. Born to a family of nine children, she was orphaned at the age of
            12.<br>
            She used her inheritance to fund her college education and became a graduate in mathematics.
            She taught at a private school before joining AT&T. While she worked there,
            she managed to complete her degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University.<br>
            She later became the first woman to enroll and earn a masters degree in electrical engineering
            from Massachusetts Institute of technology. Her most famous contribution is the Clarke calculator
            that solved equations involving hyperbolic functions ten times faster than other devices of the time.<br>
            With her perseverance and hard work, Edith followed her passion and pursued a highly successful career in
            electrical engineering.<br>

            who were human computers at the Moore School's computation lab.<br> Adele Goldstine was their teacher and
            trainer
            and they were known as the "ENIAC girls. <br> The women who worked on ENIAC were warned that they would not
            be promoted
            into professional ratings which were only for men.<br> Designing the hardware was "men's work"
            and programming the software was "women's work". Sometimes women were given blueprints and
            wiring diagrams to figure out how the machine worked and how to program it.<br>
            They learned how the ENIAC worked by repairing it, sometimes crawling through the computer,
            and by fixing "bugs" in the machinery.<br> Even though the programmers were supposed to be doing the
            "soft" work of programming, in reality, they did that and fully understood and worked with the hardware of
            the ENIAC.<br>
            When the ENIAC was revealed in 1946, Goldstine and the other women prepared the machine and the
            demonstration programs
            it ran for the public.<br> None of their work in preparing the demonstrations was mentioned in the official
            accounts of the

        <p>ALGOL 1958
            ALGOL, computer programming language designed by an international committee of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), led by Alan J. Perlis of Carnegie Mellon University, during 1958–60 for publishing algorithms, as well as for doing computations. Like LISP, ALGOL had recursive subprograms—procedures that could invoke themselves to solve a problem by reducing it to a smaller problem of the same kind. ALGOL introduced block structure, in which a program is composed of blocks that might contain both data and instructions and have the same structure as an entire program. Block structure became a powerful tool for building large programs out of small components.

        <p>Nothing or no one could hinder Annie Easley’s thirst for knowledge.
            She began her career at NACA (before it was NASA) as a “human computer” in a lab where she did computations
            for researchers.
            Once machines replaced human computers, she then continued to grow her skill set and became a computer
            programmer.
            She worked on numerous projects for NASA and her code was used in researching energy conversion systems,
            which led to battery technology used for early hybrid vehicles.
            She also worked on Centaur technology - a high-energy rocket technology to boost rockets into space.

            Still wanting to grow her knowledge, she then returned to school to get her degree in Mathematics
            while still working full time. An advocate for equality in the workplace,
            she later took on the role of equal employment opportunity counsellor at NASA
            and helped supervisors address issues of gender, race and age discrimination.

        <p>Ada is a modern programming language designed for large, long-lived applications – and embedded systems in particular – where reliability and efficiency are essential. It was originally developed in the early 1980s (this version is generally known as Ada 83) by a team led by Dr. Jean Ichbiah at CII-Honeywell-Bull in France. The language was revised and enhanced in an upward compatible fashion in the early 1990s, under the leadership of Mr. Tucker Taft from Intermetrics in the U.S. The resulting language, Ada 95, was the first internationally standardized (ISO) Object-Oriented Language.

            Documentation, 28:11–21)
            which is nearly ubiquitously used as part of the measure of the importance of various words contained in
            documents when searching for information. (The English word 'the', for example, is very unimportant, as it
            occurs in essentially all English documents, thus having high document frequency and low inverse document
            frequency.) . She was also at one time president of the Association for Computation Linguistics.
            Awards Jones won in her lifetime include Fellowships of the American and European Artificial Intelligence
            societies,
            Fellowship of the British Academy, the ACL Lifetime Achievement Award and the Lovelace Medal of the British
            Computer Society.

        <p>Carol Shaw (1955- ) is a retired video game developer, and was one of the first female video game designers.
            She was born and raised in Palo Alto, California. Her father was a mechanical engineer,
            and she preferred playing with her brother’s model railroad set over her own dolls.
            When her father got laid off, her mother went back to work at the Stanford Library, working in serial
            records
            and periodicals. She played arcade games at the miniature golf course, specifically the first commercial
            arcade game,
            Computer Space, where she would partner with her brother or a friend to control all the buttons.

            Radia Perlman is a software developer who invented the STP (Spanning-Tree Protocol),
            which is fundamental to the operation of the Internet. While studying at MIT, she took up an undergraduate
            research opportunity and developed a child-friendly robotic language, TORTIS (Toddler’s Own Recursive Turtle
            Interpreter System).
            She made many notable contributions to network design and standardization including link-state protocols.
            She is also the inventor of TRILL, a software that overcomes the shortcomings of spanning-trees.
            A pioneer in computer programming, she holds over 100 issued patents.

            Anita Borg was a computer scientist and a staunch advocate for the advancement of women programmers.
            Borg, who herself discovered programming in her 20s and graduated from New York University with a PhD in
            computer science,
            has probably done more than anyone else to advance the cause of women in tech.
            Among her endeavors:<br>
            • In 1987, she co-founded Systers, an online community for women to discuss the issues they experienced at
            work.<br>
            • In 1994, she co-founded the Grace Hopper Celebration, a gathering of women technologists that’s not only
            still going strong but continues to grow with each passing year.<br>
            • Finally, Borg created the Institute for Women and Technology, which combined her previous
            community-building efforts with new programs intended both to support women already working in tech and to
            encourage other women to enter the field.<br>
            Following Borg’s death in 2003, the organization was renamed The Anita Borg Institute for Women and
            Technology and has since shortened its name to AnitaB.org.<br>

            Barbara Liskov (b.1939) Invented 2 Programming Languages
            It was only because she couldn’t find an interesting job in mathematics that Barbara Liskov became a
            programmer,
            Barbara told EngineerGirl. With her first two years of experience in programming, Barbara was hungry to
            learn more.
            She attended Stanford University before there was even a computer science program.
            At Stanford, Barbara Liskov worked with John McCarthy on artificial intelligence projects and became the
            first woman
            to earn a doctorate in computer science at the program’s beginnings.
            Through her academic and corporate work, Barbara made significant contributions to the advance of coding.
            She led the design and implementation of CLU, the creation of the first high-level language Argus
            to support data abstraction, and the Liskov substitution principle for object-oriented programming.
            In 2008, Barbara Liskov won the A.M. Turing Award, one of the greatest honors in computer science.
            Barbara is a professor at MIT. Her innovations can be seen in every modern programming language
            including Java, C#, and C++.
            “Be prepared to change your goals if that turns out to be the right thing for you.”
            Barbara counseled upcoming women interested in technology.
